Here I am going to work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for
artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers. I will attempt to answer some questions to analyze the information in the tables.

#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

#2 Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT Customerid, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

#3 Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Invoiceid, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices ON chinook.customers.CustomerId=chinook.invoices.CustomerId
WHERE chinook.customers.Country = 'Brazil';

#4 Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT EmployeeId, FirstName, LastName, Title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT Invoiceid, SupportRepId
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices ON chinook.customers.CustomerId=chinook.invoices.CustomerId;

#7 Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT invoices.Total,
customers.FirstName AS 'CustomerFirstName',
customers.LastName AS 'CustomersLastName',
customers.Country,
employees.FirstName AS 'SalesAgentFirstName',
employees.LastName AS 'SalesAgentLastName'
FROM chinook.customers
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees ON employees.EmployeeId=customers.SupportRepId;

#8 How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId), InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#9 What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT InvoiceId, InvoiceLineId, Name
FROM chinook.invoice_items
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks ON invoice_items.TrackId=tracks.TrackId;

#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT InvoiceId, InvoiceLineId, tracks.Name AS 'track name', artists.Name AS 'artist name'

FROM chinook.employees
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers ON customers.SupportRepId=employees.EmployeeId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices ON invoices.CustomerId=customers.CustomerId
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoice_items ON invoice_items.InvoiceId=invoices.InvoiceId
WHERE Title LIKE '%Agent%'
GROUP BY employees.EmployeeId;

#14 Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
