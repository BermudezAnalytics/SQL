# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1 Who are the Top 10 artists are by popularity?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2 Who are the Top 10 artists are by danceability?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

#2 Who the Top 10 artists are by energy?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 10;

#3 What is the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#4 What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1

#5 What artist has the fastest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo DESC
LIMIT 1

#6 What artist has the slowest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY tempo ASC
LIMIT 1

#7 What is the average track speed for the top 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(tempo)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#8 What artist has the most tracks on in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY COUNT(track_name) DESC
LIMIT 5
